# Matlab-origin-talker
This is a MATLAB package for controlling Origin the scientific plotting software of the [OriginLab](https://www.originlab.com/).
The aim of this programme is to maximumly reduce the chance of repeatedly manipulating and ploting data and modifying graphs and wandering in the Origin GUI.
Instead, most of the repeated clicking, draging, etc. in Origin GUI is going to be done in MATLAB scripts.
Origin itself has support for MATLAB to control it via Origin's Automation Server, however, the support is sort of limited.
This package is to make the Origin Automation in MATLAB easier.
